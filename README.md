Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

-DriverPass requested a web-based system for student drivers to schedule and take practice exams and driving lessons. There are three package options for lessons, and the user can access their progress and study materials through their profile. There are ten cars and several instructors, and an IT admin that has overhead access to nearly all information and profiles. 

What did you do particularly well?

-I believe I crafted excellent UML diagrams. They're well organized and easy to understand from any level of knowledge on the program. They were also academically correct with proper terminology and symbols. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

-If I could revise a portion of my documents it would be my class diagram. Out of all of my diagrams it was the least comprehensive and could use some possible functions to round out the diagram.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs
when designing?

-The user's needs when designing are crucial for a few reasons but one primarily: they are the ones interacting with the system. Without a comprehensive overview of how the user will use the program, it could become hard to use, which in turn will discourage popularity and eventually lead to the program's downfall or irrelevancy. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

-I approach designing software starting with a very simplistic overview. By beginning with the very basics of a program, you can then build into a high-level design, rather than drowning in the details right away. This information is all gathered from the client through interviews and any other information gathering techniquues desired. It is then split into diagrams and charts, which can then be utilized to divvy up work. After setting a schedule and assigning tasks, it's then mainatined by regular meetings and correspondence until finished.
